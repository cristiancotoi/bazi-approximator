BaZi approximator
===================
**BaZi approximator** is a playground project for experimenting with simple neural networks.

It uses [Synaptic JS library](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic).

In order to facilitate experimentation and training on a large dataset without loosing data, it saves the network setup every few thousand iterations and reloads on every start.
